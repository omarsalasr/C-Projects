Suite of test programs for priority queue assignment.

Quick Start Guide:

  Copy your sq.c file into this directory.

  Run script ./batch2

  This should compile all test programs and link them with your
    priority queue implementation; it will then run each test and
    create log files in a subdirectory called _TEST_RESULTS

  In _TEST_RESULTS, you should find a score_summary file

The tests:

  t1.c - t6.c:  these are all "correctness" tests each of which
     focuses on 2-3 basic priority queue operations.  The tests
     are "randomized" -- but not really; the tests will run 
     the same every time -- the data just sort of looks random.

     They use the slow but functionally correct _pq functions 
     for verification.

  t7.c - t9.c:  these are also "correctness" tests which work in
     basically the same way as 1-6.  However they are "mishmash"
     tests which interleave various priority queue operations.

     Also "randomized" and use _pq for verifiation.

  t10.c - t14.c:  These are runtime tests
